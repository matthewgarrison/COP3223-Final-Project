# COP3223-Final-Project

The final project for COP3223 (Intro to Programming with C). Completed in collaboration by Matthew Garrison, Minh Pham, and Michael Cunada.

Features to be added:
* Moving platforms.
* Allow you to swing your sword while moving.
* Make enemies and the player "bounce back" when damaged.
* Read level design from a file, instead of create subclasses of Level.
